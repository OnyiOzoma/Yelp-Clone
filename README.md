## Notes

I encountered the most challenges in implementing different extensions - most of the time I spent was
on attempting extensions like the search bar (both methods), different ways to check internet connectivity,
the images, and infinite scrolling. I ultimately decided to go with this extension because I was close to the deadline,
but I will be going through and trying to add in each extension after Wednesday - so that it doesn't interfere
with grading. I look forward to doing that and then adding in some perks of my own like having an image from the
restaurant site be in the background of the recycler view, or the option to press on their menu.
